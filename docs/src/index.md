# Overview 

[`OptimizationProblems`](https://github.com/numoptim/OptimizationProblems.jl)
is a research-tier library for the Julia language that provides a set of 
optimization problems with a focus on those arising from data science problems.

The library is still in its infancy and will continue to evolve rapidly. 
The documentation has several useful components that are outlined below.

- Manual: the manual pages will help you understand how to use the library to specify
    optimization problems, preallocate memory for a problem, and evaluate 
    objective functions or derivative functions.

- API: the API pages will explain individual problems and their functionality in 
    detail.
